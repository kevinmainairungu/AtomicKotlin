## Property Accessors (#2)

Create a class `Accessible` containing `String` properties `mutable` and
`readOnly`. Add the appropriate custom property accessors to make each
property fit its name.

`mutable` property should be initialized with an empty string, and its accessors
should print `mutable:get` and `mutable:set`. `readOnly` property should print 
`readOnly:get` and return the value of `mutable`.
