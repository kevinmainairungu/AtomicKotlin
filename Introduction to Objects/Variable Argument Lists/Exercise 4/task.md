## Variable Argument Lists (#4)

The reverse operation for the `chunked()` function in the previous exercise is
called `flatten()`. This function is called on a `List` of `List`s and returns
a single `List` of all elements from the nested `List`s. Implement `flatten()`
without using the `flatten()` function from the standard library.
