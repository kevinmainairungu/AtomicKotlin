## Sets (#2)

Inside the function `experiment()` perform the following experiment.
Generate random `Int`s from 1 through 25 and place the results in a `Set`.
Discover an approximate value for the minimum number of randomly-generated
`Int`s required before the `Set` contains all values 1 through 25. Return
it as a result of the `experiment()` function.

`main` repeats your experiment 1000 times and prints the average result.
