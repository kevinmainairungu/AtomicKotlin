## Mastering the IDE: Duplicate / Delete Lines

It's easy to duplicate or delete a line:

| Operation               | Shortcut                                                  | Description                                           |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Duplicate Line or Block | <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorDuplicate;</span>  | Duplicate selected block or the line at the caret.    |
| Delete Line at Caret    | <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorDeleteLine;</span> | Delete the line where the caret is currently located. |

Display the list contents twice by duplicating the line in one click. Try
duplicating a block of code; for instance, the contents of the list:
`1, 2, 3, 4`.
