## The `with()` Function (#2)

To better understand the difference between an ordinary lambda and
a lambda with receiver, implement the toy `with2()` function which
takes an ordinary lambda as a parameter instead of a lambda with receiver.
Note that there're no function analogous to `with2()` in the standard
library, however, there're similar extension functions taking ordinary
lambdas, as explained in [Library Helpers] atom.
