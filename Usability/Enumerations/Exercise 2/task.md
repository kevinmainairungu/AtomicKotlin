## Enumerations (#2)

Implement two extension functions `Month.getAustralianSeason()` and
`Month.getDays(leapYear: Boolean)`. Note that the `leapYear` parameter has a
default value of `false`.

In Australia, the seasons are defined by grouping the calendar months this way:

* Spring - the transition months September, October and November;
* Summer - the hottest months December, January and February;
* Autumn - the transition months March, April and May;
* Winter - the coldest months June, July and August.
