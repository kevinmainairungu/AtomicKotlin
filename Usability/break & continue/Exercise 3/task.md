## `break` &amp; `continue` (#3)

This exercise demonstrates how you can replace `break` and `continue` with 
`return` while extracting some code into new functions.

The functions `usingBreak` and `usingContinue` are provided in the accompanying
code. Your task is to extract part of `usingBreak` into `analyzeList` and
part of `usingContinue` into `analyzeElement` so that `break` and `continue`
could be replaced with `return` without change in the logic of these functions.
