## Mastering the IDE: Conversion between `if` and `when`

You can convert `if` to `when` automatically and backwards.
For conversion, choose an intention action
<span class="control">`Replace 'when' with 'if'`</span>
after putting the caret on `when` keyword.
For backward conversion, choose <span class="control">`Replace 'if' with 'when'`</span>.

First, replace `when` in `getBmiStatus` function with `if` automatically.
Then apply the backwards conversion.
