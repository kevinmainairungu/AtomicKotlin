## Overloading (#1)

Implement overloaded versions of the `myJoinToString()` function. Pass default
values for arguments in each overloaded function invocation, without using the
language support for this feature.

Why can't you define the following overloaded functions?

```text
fun List.myJoinToString(separator: String, prefix: String): String
fun List.myJoinToString(prefix: String, postfix: String): String
```

Uncomment the commented `myJoinToString()` function in the solution, and see
what error you get.
