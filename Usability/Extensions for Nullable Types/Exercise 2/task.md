## Extensions for Nullable Types (#2)

Implement `and` and `or` functions on nullable Boolean which take another
nullable Boolean as a parameter and return `null` if either the receiver or
the argument is null. For non-null values these functions should behave
similarly to regular `and` and `or` operations.
