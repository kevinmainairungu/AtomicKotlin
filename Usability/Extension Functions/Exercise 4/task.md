## Mastering the IDE: Convert receiver to a parameter

You can convert a regular function into an extension and back
automatically. Put the caret on the receiver parameter, invoke
the intention list and choose
<span class="control">`Convert receiver to parameter`</span>.
Then you can type the parameter name or choose the suggested one.
Note how all the usages of the function are changed accordingly.

For a backward conversion, put the caret on the parameter, and
choose <span class="control">`Convert parameter to receiver`</span>
from the intention list.
