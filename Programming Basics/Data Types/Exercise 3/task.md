## Data Types (#3)

Guess the results of the following expressions and then check yourself using
Kotlin:

```kotlin
val c1 = 'a' + 1
val c2 = 'a' + 25
val c3 = 'E' - 2 
```

Open the 'hint' below to see the explanation of why it works like that.

Characters are stored as numbers corresponding to their 
[ASCII codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), so adding an integer to a
character produces a new character corresponding to the new code value.
