## Hello, World! (#2)

Display "Hello, Kotlin!" on the console, but with "Kotlin" appearing on the
next line. You can display two separate strings to achieve that:

```
Hello,
Kotlin!
```

Try replacing `println()` with `print()` and see what changes.

The following exercises in this book assume that you use `println()` rather
than `print()` to display data on the console.
