## Mastering the IDE: Navigating Back and Forward

You can easily navigate to a function declared in another file or to a function
in a library. In this case, it's convenient to navigate backward afterward.

You navigate backward by pressing <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:Back;</span>,
to navigate again forward press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:Forward;</span>.

Alternatively, you may choose <span class="control">`Navigate | Back`</span>
in the application menu, and <span class="control">`Navigate | Forward`</span>.
You can also choose to navigate to <span class="control">`Last Edit Location`</span>
in the same menu.

Navigate to the `foo()` function definition, then back. After that navigate to
the `println()` function definition and back.
