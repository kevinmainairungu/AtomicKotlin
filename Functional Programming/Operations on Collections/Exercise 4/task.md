## Operations on Collections (#4)

Functions `all()`, `none()` and `any()` are interchangeable, you can use one or
the other to implement the same functionality. Implement the functions
`allNonZero()` and `hasZero()` using all three predicates in turn.
`allNonZero()` checks that all the elements in the list are non-zero;
`hasZero()` checks that the list contains `zero` element. The implementations
using `all()` are given in the solution.

Note that you can add negation if necessary before the `all`, `none` or `any`
function invocation.
