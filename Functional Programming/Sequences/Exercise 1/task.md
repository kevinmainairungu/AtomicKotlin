## Sequences (#1)

All the tasks for these atom use the classes `Instructor`, `Student`, `Lesson`
and `School` defined in `School.kt`. It represents an online language school
that provides a service to organize remote lessons for an instructor and a group
of students. Each student can sign up for classes with different instructors.
After the lesson a student can rate it, and these ratings are stored together
with the other information about the lesson.

Your first task is to find all the common lessons for a given student and
instructor.
